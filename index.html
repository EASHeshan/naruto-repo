                <h2><i><u>About Manga...</u></i></h2>
                <p>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story
                    of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the
                    Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's
                    pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on
                    two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in
                    Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

                </p>
                <p>Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to
                    November 2014, with its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for
                    North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. Part I
                    of the manga was adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220
                    episodes from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo. A second series, which adapts material from
                    Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from February
                    2007 to March 2017. Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video animations
                    (OVAs). The franchise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several
                    companies. The story of Naruto continues in Boruto, where Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki creates his
                    own ninja way instead of following his father's.

                </p>
                <p>Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having 250 million copies in circulation
                    worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97
                    million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English
                    translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list
                    several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's
                    character development, storylines, and action sequences, though some felt the latter slowed the
                    story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural
                    references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism

                <h2><i><u>Naruto vs Sasuke...</u></i></h2>
                <p>The question of who is stronger between Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha is a subject of much debate
                    among fans of the Naruto series. Both characters are incredibly powerful shinobi in their own right,
                    each possessing unique abilities and strengths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Naruto Uzumaki is known for his immense chakra reserves, his mastery of the Nine-Tails' power, and
                    his ability to use Sage Mode and Six Paths Sage Mode. He also eventually becomes the Seventh Hokage,
                    indicating his exceptional skills and leadership qualities.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Sasuke Uchiha, on the other hand, is a highly skilled and intelligent shinobi with the Sharingan,
                    Mangekyo Sharingan, and Rinnegan. He is adept at various forms of ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu,
                    and he possesses the ability to manipulate space and time with his Rinnegan.
                </p>
                <p>In the Naruto series, Naruto and Sasuke are portrayed as rivals who are evenly matched in terms of
                    strength and abilities. Their final battle in the series is often seen as a demonstration of their
                    equality as shinobi. Ultimately, their strengths lie in different areas, with Naruto excelling in
                    raw power and endurance, while Sasuke is known for his strategic thinking and versatility.

                <h3><i><u>Uchiha visual powers(Sharingen)</u></i></h3>
                <p>The Sharingan's power, because of its ties to the Curse of Hatred, is both a blessing and a curse.
                    The
                    moment that an Uchiha comes to know a powerful emotion towards someone, such as love and friendship,
                    a
                    stressful or emotional condition brought out from losing that precious person causes the brain to
                    release a special form of chakra that affects the optic nerves while transforming the eyes into
                    Sharingan. After its initial activation, the Sharingan may be used freely, although it is possible
                    for
                    an Uchiha to lose memory of such an event and not reactivate it until through willpower years later.
                    When the Sharingan is first activated by a user, it has a different number of tomoe (巴; ; ; ) around
                    the
                    central pupil, varying between users.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The wielder of the Sharingan, through continued use and training, changes its form further, which
                    involves the eye maturing fully until it has three tomoe. As the Sharingan develops, the user gains
                    heightened abilities through the heightened ocular sense. For example, they can at least copy hand
                    movements with one tomoe, predict a person's movement and copy techniques with two and completely
                    use
                    the Sharingan's abilities when it is fully matured. From what characters have noted, this dōjutsu
                    apparently "glows" in the dark.True to its name, the Sharingan and its derived forms have shown the
                    ability to spin. It is shown that when a person awakens their Mangekyō Sharingan without a fully
                    matured
                    Sharingan, their Sharingan will automatically fully mature while developing into a Mangekyō
                    Sharingan.

                <h3><i><u>Nine tail Fox...</u></i></h3>
                <p>Kurama and the tailed beasts first came into being in the waning days of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, who used
                    his Creation of All Things Technique to divide the Ten-Tails' chakra into nine separate bodies and
                    giving them each a name. Some time after being created, the Sage explained to the young tailed
                    beasts that a link existed between them despite their separation. He also foretold of a day when
                    they would be brought together again - though not as they were - and that at that time someone would
                    emerge to show them what true power is.[6][7] In the anime, before his death, Hagoromo sent Kurama
                    to live in a temple built for the purpose of protecting it in a forest region with mountains that
                    would later become part of the Land of Fire.[8] Over time, Kurama gained a fearsome reputation as a
                    natural disaster that can desolate areas where the darkest aspects of human nature collect and
                    fester.
                    During the time of the founding of the shinobi villages, the Gold and Silver Brothers of Kumogakure
                    were assigned to capture Kurama, but were both swallowed whole by the fox. However, the two brothers
                    survived and gained some of its power by eating the flesh of its stomach for two weeks, forcing
                    Kurama to regurgitate them.

                </p>
                <p>After Madara Uchiha's defection from Konohagakure, he found Kurama and used his Sharingan to control
                    it, forcing the fox to help him fight against Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage. The epic battle
                    left a colossal scar in the earth that would come to be called the Valley of the End.[14][15] After
                    his victory over Madara, Hashirama's wife Mito Uzumaki sealed the fox within herself, becoming its
                    first jinchūriki.[16]

            <td>
                <p>Over the period of time which included the First and Second Shinobi World Wars, Mito kept Kurama at
                    bay except when the seal nearly broke when she was going through childbirth. Towards the final years
                    of Mito's life, it was decided that a new jinchūriki would have to be found, and that was another
                    member of her clan, Kushina Uzumaki. Although Kushina was terrified when she learned of it, Mito
                    comforted her young successor by telling her that by filling herself with love, Kushina would
                    overcome the fox's hatred.[16] This was shown years later that despite Kurama's constant attempts to
                    destroy her hope for happiness as its jinchūriki and coerce her to break the seal, Kushina's love
                    for Minato Namikaze and his love for her were proven to be strong enough to contain the fox.[17]

                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon after the end of the Third Shinobi World War, the Third Hokage made special arrangements for
                    Minato to ensure that Kurama would remain sealed inside Kushina while she gave birth to Naruto on
                    the night of October 10. However, despite keeping the childbirth a secret, a masked man called Tobi
                    tracked down their location, killed their escorts, and held Naruto hostage, forcing Minato to
                    quickly rescue him and teleport him to safety. Right after Tobi captured Kushina, he extracted and
                    seized control of Kurama, and tried to have the fox kill its barely surviving jinchūriki, but Minato
                    made it in time to save her. Soon afterwards, the masked man summoned Kurama into Konoha and ordered
                    it to destroy the village.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Kurama was rampaging in the village, Minato fought against Tobi and soon managed to place a
                    Contract Seal on him, which freed the fox from his control. Despite that, Kurama still harboured
                    resentment against Konoha for sealing it away and continued decimating the shinobi forces that tried
                    to repel it. As it prepared a Tailed Beast Ball, Minato summoned Gamabunta on top of the fox, and
                    quickly teleported it to Kushina and Naruto's location, letting its Tailed Beast Ball detonate away
                    from the village. Already dying from the extraction, Kushina used her remaining strength to restrain
                    Kurama, planning to seal the fox back inside her so it would die with her. However, knowing that
                    Kurama would revive without a host and how great a threat Tobi was, Minato instead came up with a
                    plan to give his son the means to combat the masked man in the future.
